## TL;DR 

Had an old Fire Tablet laying around, repurposed it as a [web weather app](http://43y3s.pythonanywhere.com/) display.

## But why?

Everyday, too much technology is thrown out to be collected in landfills around the world. Even if it's just me, I wanted to take part in reducing the landfill, device by device.

## Development

**Key points**
- Has to be responsive to multiple device screens
- Has to show time, date, and weather

**APIs used**
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [Google Maps](https://maps.googleapis.com/) 

**Javascript Programs**
- Show time,date > clock.js 
- Get weather every 30 minutes and update the page > weatherballoon.js

## The Final Result

All the code (except the .env variables) can be viewed [here](https://github.com/incub4t0r/malga) in my github repo. This was an exciting first dive into javascript, html, and css, and I can't wait to spend some more time learning everything better!

## What did I learn?
- Flask
- Javascript
- css styling
