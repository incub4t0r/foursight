# Quarantine 2021 Projects

In 2021, we continue to physically distance ourselves... but that just leaves more time for more projects!

* [Updating my Fire Tablet Clock](#Malga)
* [Focus on me!](#Focus)

## Malga

| Components used | Purpose | 
| - | - |
| Amazon Fire Tablet 7" | Main Display | 
| 4 sticky pads | To stick the tablet to the wall | 
| PythonAnywhere | Flask website hosting |

I wanted to use the Fire Tablet application I made last year on different devices, so I decided to recreate the entire application! This time around, however, I'm hosting the application as a web app on PythonAnywhere. Any device that has a modern screen can access and display the entire page fairly well!

## Focus

| Components used | Purpose | 
| - | - |
| Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS | An aesthetic page! | 
| https://www.000webhost.com/ | Flask web hosting | 

To further dive into web development with very simple transitions and javascript, I created [amifocused?](https://amifocused.000webhostapp.com/). This website serves one purpose; to see if you are focused on the site.

# Quarantine 2020 Projects

During this time of uncertainty in 2020 due to the global outbreak of COVID-19, I took some time to focus on some projects that I always wanted to complete. Listed below are the projects.

* [Repurposing a Fire Tablet as a permanent clock](#Fire-Tablet-Clock)
* [Pi Magic Mirror](#Magic-Mirror) 
* [Lily58 Split Ergo Mech Keyboard](#Lily58)
* [LAMP Stack in Docker](#LAMP-Stack-in-Docker)

## Magic Mirror

| Components used | Purpose | 
| - | - |
| Raspberry Pi Zero W | Single Board Computer | 
| KeDei 3.5" RPI screen | Main Display| 
| Wireless Keyboard w/ receiver | Debugging a couple issues with chromium | 
| 6ft Micro USB | Power |
| 7 sticky pads | Hang entire thing off stand | 
| Korean Red Ginseng Box | Wooden stand w/ stain | 

I wanted a little desk clock that could show a couple upcoming calendar events and the weather, and since Magic Mirror has been out for a while I thought it would be a perfect fit for my little display.

## Fire Tablet Clock

| Components used | Purpose | 
| - | - |
| Amazon Fire Tablet 7" | Main Display | 
| 4 sticky pads | To stick the tablet to the wall | 

My father wanted a simple app that was capable of functioning as a clock and weather station, as well as a couple news clips. For this I used Android Studio to create a simple visual interface, using the openweathermap api and newsapi to grab the weather and top headlines every 4 hours. 

## Lily58

![](/projects/lily58close.JPG)

| Components used | Purpose | 
| - | - | 
| Lily58 pcb from KeyHive | Keyboard base | 
| Kailh low-profile brown switches | Keyboard switches | 
| 2x OLED modules | Screens for keyboard | 
| 2x Arduino Pro Micro | Interfacing the keyboard to computer | 
| 58x diodes | Ensure that switch input goes one way only | 
| 58x hot-swap sockets | Allows for switches to be replaced in future |

Mechanical keyboards fascinate me, as well as ergonomic design, so I decided to spend some time to building my first orthogonal split mech keyboard.


## LAMP Stack in Docker

In preparations for SIGSAC lessons (shameless plug, go check out West Point SIGSAC), I was tasked with creating an SQL injection vulnerable login. I was also learning docker at the time, so I thought, "Should be fairly easy to setup a LAMP stack in docker, why not try it for sh*ts and giggles," and so I did. To be honest, I do think this method of creating a vulnerable web server is great at moving between host machines with the ability to fix any issues with a simple reboot.\
I currently don't have a finished writeup for this project yet, but I will try to get it completed during the academic year. 

# Regular Projects

## [Project Hermes](https://github.com/43y3s/projectHermes)

* *Project Hermes is a program that can transitioning point cloud data retrieved from Kinect SLAM or any other system into a tangible environment, playable and manipulable in virtual reality.*
* Struggling a little with the design of this program, will return once I have a better idea of what I am attempting to achieve

## [Project Northstar](https://developer.leapmotion.com/northstar)

* *Project Northstar is an open source augmented reality headset created and maintained by Leap Motion*
* Currently a Moderator on the Northstar subreddit, and owner of the Project Northstar [Discord](https://discord.gg/nRPJg57) (*1,500+ Members and counting!*)

## [Project EagleEye](https://github.com/43y3s/projectEagleEye)

* *Project EagleEye is a program that can recognize faces with OpenCV and track with a drone.*
* I do realize that numerous people have done this before me, but I wanted to go through the process of writing the code. Will be exciting!
