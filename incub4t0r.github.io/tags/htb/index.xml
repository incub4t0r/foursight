      <description>Another medium level box for hackthebox! As of 27MAY2021, this box is still live. If you have not solved this box please do not use this for a quick user/root.
TL;DR User: nmap, enumerate website, found .bak files, created custom php serialization script to pop a reverse shell as www-data. Horizontal movement was achieved by finding user neil&amp;rsquo;s password in a wordpress configuration file.
Root: look at sudo privileges, then add ssh key with bash script.</description>

      <description>A medium rated box that should have been rated easy
TL;DR User: OpenBSD box has ssh and http available, used gobuster and found nano .swp file which had username and shellcode. Shellcode hinted at username verification, found OpenBSD login vulnerability online using -schallenge and got Jennifer&amp;rsquo;s OpenSSH key by adding a cookie as username:jennifer, and logging in again. Saved OpenSSH key as id_rsa within new folder, changed permissions for file, and used ssh with private key to box.</description>

      <description>My first medium level box for hackthebox! And my first writeup for hackthebox.
TL;DR User: nmap, use enum4linux to find a user password and possible usernames, use hydra to test usernames with password, use evil-winrm to gain access and cat flag.
Root: found hidden files, found another user + password, used exploit guide on dnsadmins to gain root privileges.
User Getting started As always, I began with an nmap scan which returned the following:</description>
